# Docker Multicontainers in Action

This application demonstrates how multiple services in multiple Docker containers can be stitched together and hosted on an AWS account.

This particular setup contains the following services:

1. Nginx Router
2. Redis Database
3. Postgres Database
4. Express API
5. React Frontend
6. Node.js worker

This application is intentionally overcomplicated - this is clearly not how this particular app would be designed, and is instead a demonstration of the use of multiple Docker containers.
